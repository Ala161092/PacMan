# Game of Thrones | Welcome To The Targaryen House

## Description

This is my first project from the General Assembly course SEI-59. 
For my first project I went with the PacMan option. I added a GOT theme to the game. 

## Getting Started
To ensure I didn't get overwhelmed I started with psuedo code. I wrote out the logic of the game and included where I would be adding any sounds or animations. 

### Technologues Used

* JavaScript (ES6)
* HTML5 
* CSS3


### How to Play

```
Use the arrow functions on your keyboard to navigate your way through the maze
You must gather all the fire embers before you run out of time.
For each ember you collect you will gain 50points.
Be sure to avoid thse white walkers! If you get to your dragon in time you will gain an extra life!
Hurry now! Time is of the essence! Click the start button to get things moving
